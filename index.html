        <h3>Data Analysis and Visualisation</h3>
        <p>My passion is using code and statistics to extract insights from data. I have spent many years working on statistical projects and have studied statistical
          techniques at a Masters level. I am experienced in using Econometric methods
          such as Regression Discontinuity Design. Communicating information through visuals is so important and I have a
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQFtH_p-8Pj7ltzuBgs49Xw/featured">Youtube channel called GlobeRanker</a> showing some of my capabilities.
